# Crowdeo
Crowdeo is a web application for creating and searching events.
Application uses user's location and makes appropriate assumptions for events filtering.

## Tech
- `Ruby on Rails` (framework)
- `Postgres` with `Postgis` extension (users data, events data and location aware search)
- `Redis` (events views counting)
- `Leaflet` (maps)
- `IP API` (determining user's location)
- `Bootstrap`

## Memo
This was my first ever website that I've coded. 
Metting with ruby, javascript and bootstrap for the first time, too.

Great experience!
